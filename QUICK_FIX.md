# 🚨 Quick Fix for F5 Not Working

## 🎯 **Most Common Issue: Wrong Folder Open**

### **Problem**: You're opening individual files instead of the project folder
### **Solution**: Open the entire KNOWCODE project folder

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Close VS Code Completely**
1. Quit VS Code (`Cmd+Q`)
2. Make sure it's completely closed

### **Step 2: Open the Correct Folder**
```bash
# In terminal, make sure you're in the knowcode directory
cd /Users/shreeyagupta/knowcode

# Open VS Code with the ENTIRE project folder
open -a "Visual Studio Code" .
```

**IMPORTANT**: The `.` at the end opens the CURRENT FOLDER, not individual files.

### **Step 3: Verify You're in the Right Place**
In VS Code, you should see:
- ✅ `package.json` in the file explorer
- ✅ `src/` folder
- ✅ `out/` folder
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ All project files visible

**If you see individual files instead of folders**: You opened the wrong thing!

### **Step 4: Test F5**
1. Press `F5` in VS Code
2. **Expected**: A new VS Code window opens
3. **Look for**: "KNOWCODE extension is now active! 🎉" message

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working**

### **Check 1: Are you in the right directory?**
```bash
# In terminal, run:
pwd
# Should show: /Users/shreeyagupta/knowcode

ls -la
# Should show: package.json, src/, out/, etc.
```

### **Check 2: Is VS Code opening the right folder?**
In VS Code:
- Look at the title bar - should show "KNOWCODE" or "knowcode"
- Look at the file explorer - should show project structure
- Look at the bottom status bar - should show the project path

### **Check 3: Try Alternative Opening Method**
```bash
# Method 1: From terminal
cd /Users/shreeyagupta/knowcode
code .

# Method 2: From VS Code
# File → Open Folder → Navigate to /Users/shreeyagupta/knowcode → Select Folder
```

## 🎯 **What Should Happen**

When you press F5:
1. ✅ A new VS Code window opens (Extension Development Host)
2. ✅ You see a welcome message
3. ✅ The extension is loaded and ready

## 🚨 **Common Mistakes**

❌ **Wrong**: Opening individual files like `package.json` or `extension.ts`
✅ **Correct**: Opening the entire project folder

❌ **Wrong**: Opening a parent folder that contains knowcode
✅ **Correct**: Opening the knowcode folder itself

❌ **Wrong**: Opening VS Code and then opening files
✅ **Correct**: Opening VS Code with the project folder

## 📞 **Still Not Working?**

If you're still having issues:

1. **Take a screenshot** of your VS Code window
2. **Check the terminal** - what directory are you in?
3. **Check VS Code** - what folder is open?
4. **Try the alternative opening methods** above

The most common issue is opening individual files instead of the project folder. Make sure you're opening the ENTIRE knowcode folder in VS Code!
