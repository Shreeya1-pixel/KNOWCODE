## 🎯 **How to Test Right Now**

### **Step 1: Launch Extension**
```bash
# In VS Code:
# Press F5 to launch extension
```

### **Step 2: Open Panel**
```bash
# Press Cmd+Shift+P
# Type: "KNOWCODE: Open Panel"
# Click the command
```

### **Step 3: Test with Code**
1. **Create a new file** (e.g., `test.js`)
2. **Add this code**:
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
3. **Click "👶 Explain like I'm 5"**
4. **Wait 10-30 seconds** (normal for local AI)

## 🔍 **Debugging Console**

### **Check VS Code Console**
1. **View → Output**
2. **Select "KNOWCODE"** from dropdown
3. **Look for these messages**:
   - "KNOWCODE: generateExplainLike5 called"
   - "KNOWCODE: generateExplanation called with mode: explain5"
   - "KNOWCODE: Built prompt for mode: explain5"
   - "KNOWCODE: Using model: llama2:7b-chat"

### **Expected Console Output**
```
KNOWCODE: generateExplainLike5 called with code: function add(a, b) { return a + b; }...
KNOWCODE: Context: 
KNOWCODE: generateExplanation called with mode: explain5
KNOWCODE: Built prompt for mode: explain5
KNOWCODE: Using model: llama2:7b-chat
KNOWCODE: Got response, length: 245
```

## 🎈 **Expected Response**
The AI should respond with something like:
```
🤖 Hey there, little buddy! 😊

This code is like a magic calculator that adds two numbers together! 

Think of it like this:
- You have two toy cars 🚗🚗
- You put them together 
- Now you have two cars! 🚗🚗

The code does the same thing with numbers:
- It takes two numbers (like 5 and 3)
- It adds them together 
- It gives you the answer (8!)

It's super simple and fun! 🎉
```

## 🚨 **If It's Not Working**

### **Check 1: Model Connection**
```bash
# In terminal:
ollama run llama2:7b-chat "Hello"
# Should respond with AI text
```

### **Check 2: Extension Logs**
- Look at VS Code console for error messages
- Check if "KNOWCODE: generateExplainLike5 called" appears

### **Check 3: Button Click**
- Make sure you're clicking the "👶 Explain like I'm 5" button
- Not the regular "Explain" button

## 🎉 **Ready to Test!**

The extension is compiled and ready. The model is working. Just:

1. **Press F5** in VS Code
2. **Open KNOWCODE panel**
3. **Add some code**
4. **Click "👶 Explain like I'm 5"**
5. **Wait for the magic!** ✨

**The feature should work perfectly now!** 🚀
