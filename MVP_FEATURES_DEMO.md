# 🚀 KNOWCODE MVP Features Demo Guide

## 🎯 **5 Core MVP Features**

### 1. **👶 Explain Like I'm 5**
**What it does**: AI simplifies code into ultra-simple language using everyday analogies
**How to use**:
1. Select code in VS Code
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+M` (or Command Palette → "KNOWCODE: Explain with Mode")
3. Choose "👶 Explain like I'm 5"
4. Get child-friendly explanation with analogies

**Example Output**:
```
# 👶 Explain Like I'm 5

## 🏠 Think of this like a recipe!
Just like how a recipe tells you step-by-step how to make cookies, 
this code tells the computer step-by-step what to do.

## 📦 Variables are like boxes!
Imagine you have different boxes where you put your toys. Each box 
has a name (like "my favorite toy") and you can put different things inside it.

## 📝 What this code does:
1. This creates a new helper (like a recipe)
2. This saves something in a box for later
3. This checks if something is true (like checking if it's raining)
```
