# KNOWCODE Extension Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® F5 Not Working - Extension Won't Launch

### Step 1: Check Extension Development Host
1. **Press F5** in VS Code
2. **Wait for new window** - A new VS Code window should open with "Extension Development Host" in the title
3. **Check the title bar** - It should say "Extension Development Host" not just "Visual Studio Code"

### Step 2: Check Console for Errors
1. In the **Extension Development Host** window, go to **View ‚Üí Output**
2. Select **"KNOWCODE"** from the dropdown
3. Look for any error messages or the activation message: "KNOWCODE extension is now active! üéâ"

### Step 3: Verify Extension is Active
1. In the **Extension Development Host** window, press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type "KNOWCODE" - you should see all the KNOWCODE commands
3. If you don't see them, the extension isn't active

### Step 4: Check Status Bar
1. Look at the **bottom status bar** in the Extension Development Host window
2. You should see "KNOWCODE" on the right side
3. Click it to toggle overlay mode

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

## üéØ Testing the Extension

### Quick Test Steps:

4. **Press Ctrl+Shift+E** to explain the selection
5. **You should see** a beautiful explanation panel open

### Test All Features:
1. **Basic Explanation**: `Ctrl+Shift+E` on selected code
2. **Enhanced Explanation**: `Ctrl+Shift+M` for multiple modes

### Common Solutions:
1. **Restart VS Code** completely
2. **Delete node_modules** and run `npm install` again
3. **Clear VS Code cache**: Delete `.vscode-test` folder
4. **Check VS Code version**: Make sure it's compatible (^1.85.0)

### Get Help:
